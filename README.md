# Android-Unquote-Project

This project was written in Java and Android studio

The file is an application where the user has to answer a series of trivias questions based on Quotes celebrities have said. The user will try to match quotes to certain celebrities. There are fake quotes next to the celebrities faces which can trick the user. Quotes can come from movies as well. The Quote order is randomized each time and the user's score is tracked and displayed when all the questions are answered.
